## Model Comparisons

| **Model**               | **Purpose**                | **Speed**         | **Accuracy**       | **Use Case**                                   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Tiny Face Detector**   | Face detection             | Fast              | Moderate           | Suitable for real-time apps where speed is crucial, but may miss small/obscured faces. |
| **SSD MobilenetV1**      | Face detection             | Moderate          | High               | Great for accuracy-focused projects; balances detection precision and performance.    |
| **MTCNN**               | Face detection + landmarks | Moderate          | High               | Detects faces and key landmarks accurately with a good balance between speed and accuracy. |
| **FaceLandmark68Net**    | Detailed landmarks         | Moderate          | High               | Provides 68 facial landmarks for tasks requiring precise face alignment.               |
| **FaceRecognitionNet**   | Embedding generation       | Moderate          | High               | Generates face embeddings for recognition; essential for identity verification tasks.  |

### Key Insights
- **Tiny Face Detector** is best when you need fast performance at the expense of some detection accuracy.
- **SSD MobilenetV1** offers a good balance of speed and accuracy, better suited for situations where detecting smaller faces or more complex scenarios is critical.
- **MTCNN** provides more detailed face detection and localization, and is a great option if you need both speed and precise landmark detection.
- **FaceLandmark68Net** ensures high-quality landmark detection for further face analysis (e.g., facial feature extraction).
- **FaceRecognitionNet** is essential for generating accurate face embeddings for recognition and matching.
